**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview

This is an API for the City Explorer application, where users can submit the name of a city and get back information, like weather and coordinates, for that city.

## Getting Started

Ensure you have an API key for Location IQ.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:
